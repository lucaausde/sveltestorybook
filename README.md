> Svelte template

#### State of development: üê£ [May, 8. 2020]

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. To simplify the development workflow, this template extends [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) - with some addons - as well as other modules like [svelte-themer](https://github.com/josefaidt/svelte-themer) and [svelte-i18n](https://github.com/kaisermann/svelte-i18n). Feel free to use, copy, modify, merge or publish this template.

### Getting started ...

1. After cloning this repository, please install all dependencies with either npm or yarn.

```bash
yarn
```

2. Once you're done and did not run into errors, start eiter storybook or the development server.

```bash
yarn storybook
yarn dev
```

3. When finished developing, build the app.

```bash
yarn build
```

## New to Svelte?

Check out their [tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) or read their [documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs).

## Don't know how to write stories?

Take the `Text` component as reference. `Text` is currently residing at [/src/components/atoms/Text/Text.svelte](https://github.com/lucaausde/sveltestorybook/blob/master/src/components/atoms/Text/Text.svelte). And the component's story at [/src/components/atoms/Text/Text.stories.js](https://github.com/lucaausde/sveltestorybook/blob/master/src/components/atoms/Text/Text.stories.js).

```bash
import YourComponent from "./YourComponent.svelte";

export default { title: "YourComponent" };

export const description = () => ({
  Component: YourComponent,
  props: {
    text: "Passing a prop",
  },
});

```

## Want to use variables?

No problem, I've got you covered. With [svelte-themer](https://github.com/josefaidt/svelte-themer) you can easily create themes and access [variables](https://github.com/lucaausde/sveltestorybook/blob/master/src/constants/theme/theme.js) in all Svelte files. Check out this [example](https://github.com/lucaausde/sveltestorybook/blob/master/src/components/atoms/Text/Text.svelte)!

Thank you for using my template! üèÜ
